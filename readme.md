## Zeshan's Laravel Blog

This is my blog written in PHP, JS, JQuery, and CSS on the Laravel Framework. 

## Getting Started
-Clone this repository
-Create a database for this application
-Create a 'env.local.php' file inside of 'blog.dev/'
Add the contents of 'env-template.php' to 'env.local.php'
-Add your database logins to the values
-Run 'composer install'

The project is built using a MVC architecture. This is my first time doing this!
